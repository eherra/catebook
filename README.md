### about Catebook

The project has been made with a help of Java Spring boot, Spring MVC, Thymeleaf template engine for HTML modifications and some Bootstrap here and there. 

Main focus has been on website's back end programming, but front end was not left without attention. (The UX might not be the best)

### How to get started.
